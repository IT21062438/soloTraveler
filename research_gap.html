      <h1>Research Gap</h1>
      <p>
        Despite developments in traffic management technology, Sri Lanka's
        present systems still have substantial shortcomings. One significant gap
        is the underutilization of real-time data, as current systems do not
        integrate with real-time traffic violation data, resulting in
        inefficiencies in law enforcement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, there is no comprehensive solution that incorporates
        critical components such as automated violation detection, predictive
        analytics, penalty systems, and geospatial mapping. Another major gap is
        the lack of comparative studies evaluating various traffic enforcement
        approaches, which limits the capacity to identify the most effective
        ways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, existing research does not focus on proactive ways to manage
        emerging traffic violation problems, leaving prospective vulnerabilities
        unresolved. Scalability remains a significant issue, with few research
        discussing how traffic management systems might be expanded for
        widespread application across the country. These shortcomings underscore
        the importance of more integrated, data-driven, and scalable systems to
        improve traffic enforcement in Sri Lanka.
